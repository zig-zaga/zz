### ðŸ’  Shape-O-Rama : Pattern Party! ðŸ’ 

In this project, the children will learn how to create patterns and shapes using functions in a programming environment. The project will guide them through breaking down complex designs into smaller, reusable pieces of code, called functions. By the end of the project, the children will be able to create intricate patterns by combining simple shapes theyâ€™ve generated with their functions.

#### **What the Children Will Be Doing:**
- **Lesson 1:** Introduction to functions. The children will start by defining simple functions that draw basic shapes. They will use loops to repeat these shapes and create patterns.
  
- **Lesson 2:** Building on the functions from the first lesson, the children will create more complex patterns by combining multiple shapes. Theyâ€™ll explore how slight modifications in their functions can lead to entirely new patterns.
  
- **Lesson 3:** The final lesson will introduce interactivity, allowing users to influence the patterns by choosing shapes or adjusting parameters like size or repetition. This will make their project dynamic and engaging.

#### **What the Children Will Be Learning:**
- **Understanding Functions:** Children will learn how to break down tasks into reusable pieces of code, reinforcing the concept of functions as a way to simplify programming tasks.
  
- **Problem-Solving:** By creating and modifying patterns, the children will enhance their problem-solving skills, experimenting with different approaches to achieve the desired outcomes.
  
- **Interactivity:** The children will learn how to make their projects interactive, providing a basic understanding of how user input can affect the output of a program.

#### **Why This is Important:**
This project builds on the childrenâ€™s existing knowledge of loops, variables, and conditional statements. By introducing functions, theyâ€™ll learn a crucial concept in programming that will allow them to write more efficient and organized code.

The interactive aspect of the project also introduces the idea of user experience in programming, helping the children understand how programs can respond to user inputs.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Understanding functions is a *fundamental* step towards more advanced programming, and this project provides a practical and creative way to apply this knowledge

### Key Vocabulary

Hereâ€™s a list of key vocabulary that the children will need for the shape-o-rama pattern party project:

#### 1. **Function**
   - A set of instructions grouped together to perform a specific task when called.

#### 2. **Call (or Invoke)**
   - The action of executing a function within a program.

#### 3. **Loop**
   - A programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times.

#### 4. **Iteration**
   - Each time a loop runs is called an iteration.

#### 5. **Variable**
   - A named storage in programming that holds a value, which can change.

#### 6. **Conditional Statement**
   - Code that only runs if a certain condition is met, often using `if` or `if-else` statements.

#### 7. **Pattern**
   - A repeated decorative design or sequence, often created using loops and functions in code.

#### 8. **Shape**
   - Geometric figures (like squares, triangles, circles) that can be drawn using code.

#### 9. **Parameter (Advanced)**
   - While this project doesnâ€™t use parameters, understanding that parameters are inputs to a function can be useful for more advanced students.

#### 10. **Boolean Logic**
   - A branch of algebra involving true or false values, often used in conditions.

#### 11. **Mathematical Operators**
   - Symbols like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` used to perform calculations.

#### 12. **Broadcast**
   - Sending a signal in programming that can trigger other actions or functions.

#### 13. **Event**
   - An action that causes something to happen, like clicking a button or completing a loop.

#### 14. **Abstraction**
   - Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.

#### 15. **Decomposition**
   - Breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

These terms will help the children better understand the concepts and tasks involved in the project, providing them with the language needed to discuss and explore the ideas in their code.
